# nrepl-profile

> ## This functionality has been [integrated into CIDER itself](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/pull/2197). Don't use this project if using a version of CIDER with built-in profiling, as it would cause problems.

nREPL and CIDER support for
[thunknyc/profile](http://github.com/thunknyc/profile).

## Introduction

Profiling is a rich and varied field of human endeavour. I
encourage you to consider what you're trying to accomplish by
profiling. This package for CIDER may not be suited to your current
needs. What is nrepl-profile good for? It's intended for
interactive profiling applications where you do not expect a
profiling tool to automatically compensate for JVM warm-up and
garbage collection issues. If you are doing numeric computing or
writing other purely functional code that can be executed
repeatedly without unpleasant side effects, I recommend you at the
very least check out [Criterium](https://github.com/hugoduncan/criterium).

If you are primarily concerned about the influence of JVM-exogenous
factors on your code—HTTP requests, SQL queries, other network- or
(possibly) filesystem-accessing operations—then this package may be
just what the doctor ordered.

## Installation

[![MELPA](http://melpa.org/packages/cider-profile-badge.svg)](http://melpa.org/#/cider-profile)

Add `[thunknyc/nrepl-profile "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` to the vector
associated with the `:plugins` key of your `:user` profile inside
`${HOME}/.lein/profiles.clj`. Schematically, like this:

```clojure
{:user {:plugins [[thunknyc/nrepl-profile "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]]}}
```

Obviously the plug-in for CIDER needs to be in there too.

For Emacs, stick `cider-profile.el` somewhere accessible and add
`(require 'cider-profile)` to your `${HOME}/.emacs`,
`${HOME}/.emacs.d/init.el`, whatever.

Add the following to your `init.el`, `.emacs`, whatever:

```
(add-hook 'cider-mode-hook 'cider-profile-mode)
(add-hook 'cider-repl-mode-hook 'cider-profile-mode)
```

If you would like to display profiling statistics in the current repl
window instead of in a pop-up window, do the following:

```
(setq cider-profile-buffer nil)
```

## Keybindings

Cider-profile includes the following keybindings out of the box:

* `C-c =`   Toggle profiling of var under point.
* `C-c +`   Toggle profiling of namespace.
* `C-c M-=` Report whether var under point is profiled.
* `C-c M-+` Display (and, with `C-u`, set) current maximum per-var samples.
* `C-c -`   Display summary of profiling data.
* `C-c M--` Display profiling data for var under point.
* `C-c _`   Clear collected profiling data.
